# Hotel Reservation System

This school project is for the Enterprise Systems Server-side Design and Development Module which train students to be conversant in backend or server-side development for Enterprise Systems. It involves a development project consisting of teams in pairs. I collaborated with a partner to develop a hotel reservation system backend application using Java EE. Implemented core functionalities with Component-Based Architecture (CBA) and Service-Oriented Architecture (SOA). Additionally, we designed and tested simple client interactions via a Command-Line Interface (CLI).
